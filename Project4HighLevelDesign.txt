 Part 1:
	1. Create a class that holds data for a general student.
    2. Create instance variables for student id, name, school, extracurricular activities, and homeroom teacher.
    3. Create get and set methods for the instance variables.
    4. Create a method named toString() that has no parameters and return a string with the data about this class.
    5. Next, create a subclass of the first class for kindergarten students. This class will add new field and override a method.
    6. Add a new instance variable for show and tell item. Create get and set methods for the field.
    7. Override the toString() method and output information on kindergarten students. Label the student as a kindergarten student and include the show and tell item.
    8. Include these classes in your high-level design, class identification, Prepcode, and Test code.
	
 Part 2:
	1. Create an abstract class that includes some basic data about students. The data should be similar to part 1 but be general enough for all students from K-12.
    2. Create an abstract method in the abstract class that creates a progress report on the student.
    3. Create an interface named TestTaker that declares the following methods:
        a. takeTest – This method will have no parameters and no return value.
        b. getTestResults – This method will have no parameters and will return a String.
    4. Create 3 classes that extend the abstract class. One for high-school students, one for middle-school students, and one for elementary students.
    5. The 3 subclasses will implement the TestTaker interface.
    6. Add one or more instance variables to the subclasses that are specific to the type of student. Add get and set methods for these new fields.
    7. Implement the abstract method in the superclass in each subclass. This method can return a string or output data to the terminal
